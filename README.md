This project was quite challenging for me but with the help of research on google I managed to create a functional Password Generator.
Javascript is a whole different ballpark, but I am adamant on imroving my skills with more useful projects like this.
I enjoyed the use of if statements which are interesting as they can be used in so many different situations. Im my case I used if statements to confrim what selections of characters the user wants to use with the password generator.
